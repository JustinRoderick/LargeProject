# Trello Workflow

## Trello Overview

Trello is a Project Management Tool that we will be using to help keep track of task and plans.<br>
Trello should be the first resource that you check to know what you and your teammates should be doing.<br>
Trello is composed of Lists and Cards. You can envision Trello Like a white board where you can move sticky notes around.

# Trello Filter

Trello has a filter feature on the right-side of the task bar that allows you to filter by:

- Members (You can see what you are responsible for)
- Due Date (You can see when your deadlines)
- Labels (you can see what your role are responsible for)

# Calander Powerup

Along with the Filter Feature, we have a Calander Powerup at allows you to see due dates in the form of a calendar.<br>
This is found on the Taskbar as well,

# Trello Card Template

Trello Card Templates are presets cards that already have some information configured.

On the Bottom of each list, there is an option to create a new card through the template option.

Trello will then open already made template cards that already have the label (The Role’s Responsibility) and person that you can choose.

You also have the option to edit the template as well as add a new template if necessary (Please hide the template card to prevent confusion)

# Workflow Example:

Say that I want to work on want to work on making Feature C for App.

Firstly, I would look at “📜 Planned Task”, “🛠️On Going”, “⏳Pending”, “✅Done” List to see what if Feature C is already being worked on:

- If it is in “📜 Planned Task”, then add yourself (Change Member) and drag it to “🛠️On Going”.
- If it is in “🛠️On Going” or “⏳Pending”, then ask the current member working on it if you can join (If yes, the add yourself (Change Member)
- If it is in “✅Done List” and if it still needs to be worked on discuss with the current member working on it and move it to “🛠️On Going” if it needs to be worked on. (Change Due Date if needed)
- If it isn’t in either, then create a card (Use Template if possible)
- Add: Card Info (Label \[Role\], Members, Checklist, Due Date, etc.)

While working:

- If everything is done:
  - If there are other members, discuss with them if the task is finished.
  - Check/Click the Due Date (If present)
  - Drag the Card into “✅Done List”.
- If a roadblock/prerequisite is discovered (I.E. Waiting for Backend, API, Frontend):
  - Try to finish other things on the card if possible.
  - Let the other group members know of the issues.
  - Drag the Card into “⏳Pending”.
